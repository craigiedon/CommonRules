## Setup

### Installation Prerequisites

To install required libraries, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The MPC-controller for the Automated Vehicle uses [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com) for Non-Linear Program Solving, so you will need a [License](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).


Any extra steps when you go to run?

TODO: Put on new env and attempt to run the ground truths
TODO: Attempt to run AMS and CE. Any issues?

## Pre-requisites of Preparing the Data to train the surrogate
## Training the Surrogate?

## Running Experiments

### ``Ground Truth'' Simulations

### Importance Sampler Baselines

### Adaptive Multilevel Splitting

## Analysing Results

### Visualizing a Run

### Charting Results
